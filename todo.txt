Some Issues :

Windows Port:
- For some reason DirectDraw runs very slow on 3dfx cards.
  Is this possible to fix?  Or maybe implementing a glide mode would fix it.
  DirectDraw blit routines are probably not handled in an optimal way
- DirectSound in ZSNESw doesn't support the primary sound buffer.
  Unfortunately, this causes 8-bit quality sounds on certain computers.
- DirectInput seems to cause some systems to really slow down for some
  odd reason.  When those systems that are affected disables their joystick
  from the control panel, the framerate suddenenly goes up from choppy to
  smooth.
- VSync or triple buffering not implemented
- Glide,OpenGL, or Direct3D support would be nice
- .ZIPed files seems to not work on certain Win2K configurations
- Use another (free) compiler for the windows version (cygwin?)
- Auto-detect high/low latency connections and adjust settings accordingly

General
- Maybe add in Cubic Spline Interpolation to the SNES DSP Sound processor
  (DSPPROC.ASM) since some people like the clarity of it compared to
  Gaussian Interpolation (even though that's the method the real snes uses) 
  and also make a variable to select between those interpolations (If
  someone can do this, I'll add an option to switch between them in the
  GUI later)
- Clean up the makefiles (get rid of this ugly link.win32)
- ZSNES doesn't compile with nasm 0.98.08 because of problems with 
  the way it deals with loops
  
Compatibility
- Game not working - Guikuden 1 (and some more)
- Graphics Glitches - Uniracers (2p mode), Killer Instinct (couple stages,
    black background), FF3 (some sprite clipping probs), Metal Combat,
    Tactic Ogre (Menus?)
- Special Chips - DSP1 (60% done), DSP2 (0% done), SA-1 (95% done),
                  SDD-1 (decompression left), and others
