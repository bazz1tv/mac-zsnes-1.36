Requirements (For Developer)
----------------------------
Need 32-bit libraries

ZLIB:
http://www.zlib.net/
to compile zlib, I did the following (probably overkill): 
-- 
export CC="/usr/bin/gcc -arch i386" 
export CXX="/usr/bin/g++ -arch i386" 
export GCOV="/usr/bin/gcov -arch i386" 
export CPPFLAGS="-arch i386" 
export CFLAGS="-arch i386" 
export CXXFLAGS="-arch i386" 
export LDFLAGS="-arch i386" 
./autogen.sh 
./configure 
make
sudo make install
--

SDL 1.2:
http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php

to compile sdl 1.2.15 on my Mavericks: patch necessary: 
@@ -91,7 +91,9 @@ typedef struct SDL_PrivateVideoData {
     CGDirectDisplayID  display;            /* 0 == main display (only support single display) */
     const void         *mode;              /* current mode of the display */
     const void         *save_mode;         /* original mode of the display */
+#if (MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED < 1070)
     CGDirectPaletteRef palette;            /* palette of an 8-bit display */
+#endif
     NSOpenGLContext    *gl_context;        /* OpenGL rendering context */
     NSGraphicsContext  *nsgfx_context;     /* Cocoa graphics context */
     Uint32             width, height, bpp; /* frequently used data about the display */

I built probably under same context as ZLIB but without ./autogen.sh

Changes to ZSNES (same for the most part if not all in 1.42)
----------------

zfilew.c
--------
had to make fnamest, fnames and GetFilename() be mentioned as arrays (which they are anyways)
because OSX strcpy does bounds checking and a char is not long enough in its eyes.

had to do the same thing to SRAMDir and obtaindir()

Adding stack alignment code to WaitForKey

gui.asm
--------
guifirsttimemsg:
changed jne .pressedokay to jmp .pressedokay. This is because the keyboard
reception is awful.. literally cannot press a key that is interpreted as spacebar..
Luckily the mouse works and some keys too.. I can set my joystick flawlessly..
I can write a remote IP address too.

ui.asm
------
getcmdline: 
around call to getenv, put stack alignment stuffz, here's an example of "stack align stuffz":
; bazz start
    mov ebx, esp        ; remember current esp
    and esp, 0xFFFFFFF0 ; align to next 16 byte boundary (could be zero offset!)
    sub esp, 12         ; skip ahead 12 so we can store original esp
    push ebx            ; store esp (16 bytes aligned again)
    ; bazz end 
    call getenv
    ; bazz start
    pop ebx             ; get original esp
    mov esp, ebx        ; restore
    ; bazz end 

I removed the WaitForKey after the Code Alignment Failure :


Configure
----------
CFLAGS="-arch i386 -I/opt/local/include -I/usr/local/include/SDL" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure --build=i386-pc-bsd --host=i386-pc-bsd --target=i386-pc-bsd --enable-debug --without-opengl --with-sdl-prefix=/usr/local --disable-sdltest

CFLAGS="-arch i386 -I/opt/local/include -I/usr/local/include/SDL" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure --build=i386-pc-bsd --host=i386-pc-bsd --target=i386-pc-bsd --without-opengl --with-sdl-prefix=/usr/local --disable-sdltest

Makefile
--------
to all C files: -mmacosx-version-min=10.5 -mstackrealign -arch i386
nasm files: 
use /usr/bin/nasm not /opt/local/nasm.. 
remove -DELF, change -f elf to -f macho

zsnes target: 
add the following: -mmacosx-version-min=10.5 -mstackrealign -arch i386 -Wl,-no_pie

for non-debug build, remove in gcc lines: -fschedule-insns2 

for static build: /usr/local/lib/libz.a `/usr/local/bin/sdl-config --static-libs`

Other Mods:
===========


Issues
------
Code Alignment Failure at startup.. but zsnes seems to still be working luckily.



History
-------
The initial trouble I ran into was the -DELF and -f elf in nasm.. it led to symbol carnival.. 
lots of missing symbols prefixed by underscores.. it was a mystery.. I first learned about --prefix _
option which seemed to help alot but not wholly.. then I got lucky to learn
that the secret lied inside MAN pages which the macho format I was aware is Apple's.. at first I had
-DELF and -f macho then I realized that the -DELF was causing the symbol behaviour. Once I removed it I was
home sweet home. and I'm cutting out bits and pieces of my story cause I'm no patient to tell it in fine detail.
