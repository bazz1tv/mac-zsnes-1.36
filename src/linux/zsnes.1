.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBzSNES\fP is an emulator for the Super Nintendo video game console, written mostly in assembler by zsKnight and _Demo_ (who also works on ePSXe), with Pharos and Teuf as assistant coders. Originally a DOS program, it has now been ported to Windows and Linux. All core udpates will be done simultaneously (i.e. for DOS, Windows, and Linux versions).

.SH "FILES AND DIRECTORIES"
.TP
zsnes
The main program
.TP
~/.zsnes
The directory where the save states, screenshots, and movie files are stored. This directory is created by zsnes
.TP
~/.zsnes/zsnesl.cfg
Where configuration settings are stored. This file is created by zsnes.
.TP
~/.zsnes/.zguicfgl.dat
The dat file for the GUI. This file is created by zsnes. \fBIf for some reason you update your version of zsnes and it keeps crashing before you can do anything, you should try deleting this file and have zsnes create a new one.\fP


.SH "GRAPHICS PACKS"
The graphics packs for games such as Star Ocean, Street Fighter Alpha, and others must be stored in the ~/.zsnes directory. For example, if you have Star Ocean, you will need to place the graphics pack in ~/.zsnes/SOCNSDD1 and the files within that directory must all be lowercase. (This will remain this way until the authors decide to make changes in the init.asm file.) As of version 1.337, the directory name of the graphics packs must be capitalized and all files within that directory are in lowercase.


.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fIzsnesgui(1)\fP and \fIzsnesfaq(1)\fP, neither of which happens to be written yet. (Hey, this is a work in progress.)


.SH "SPECIAL CHIP GAMES"
Many games that use special chips do not work, including but not limited to the following:


SuperFX:

- Dirt Trax FX

- Winter Gold


DSP-1 (and variants):

- Pilotwings

- Top Gear 3000


SDD-1:

- Street Fighter Alpha 2 now works with the DeJap graphics pack.

- Star Ocean now works with the DeJap graphics pack.


SPC7110:

- Far East of Eden Zero works with the DeJap graphics pack.
