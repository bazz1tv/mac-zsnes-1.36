ZSNES is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator written mostly
in assembler.

We would really like to thank the snes9x team for all their help and
also for an excellent snes emulator.  We also wish them the very best
of luck!

3.) System Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fast Pentium processor strongly recommended
- 32MB of RAM
- Windows 95/98/ME/2000 or compatible
- DirectX 7.0 or higher

Recommended System for SFX support :

- Fast Pentium processor (P200 - P2-300 (depending on the game))
- 32MB of RAM
- Windows 95/98/ME/2000 or compatible
- DirectX 7.0 or higher

Recommended System for SA-1 support : (Mario RPG)

- Fast Pentium processor (P200 or higher)
- 32MB of RAM
- Windows 95/98/ME/2000 or compatible
- DirectX 7.0 or higher

*An FPU is required for DSP1 emulation
*You can download directx at www.microsoft.com/directx/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.) Things you should know about ZSNES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- You can use both keyboard and joystick for player 1 or 2 with some
  configuration adjustments.  Refer to zsnes.faq for details
- Several special chip emulation (SA-1) have unknown bugs to
  them
- SuperFX can be slow because it is an extra 10/20mhz cpu that has to be
    emulated as well as the snes emulation
- Screen Snapshot and FPS counter are available through a menu by pressing
    F1 during emulation
- Screen Snapshot currently saves as Image.PCX (256 colors) and Image.BMP
    (65536 colors).  This may change in the future.
- FPS counter currently only works when auto frame rate is on.
- To use the cheat function, be sure to have the ROM which you want to
    patch loaded already.
- If the cheat codes do not work, chances are that you are using a different
    version of the rom that was originally used to create them or the codes
    are converted incorrectly from other code formats.
- There are still many bugs left in ZSNES so don't expect it to run all
    your favorite games.
- SNES Mouse support is still missing some features such as speed settings
- Pressing the Fast Forward key is equivalent to running ZSNES using -f 9
- If ZSNES doesn't work for you, then don't use it.  Use SNES9X, NLKE,
    SNEESE, or SNEMUL instead!  In fact, even if you use ZSNES,
    use those emulators too!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is removed

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.) ZSNES Default Keys
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the default keys while running the emulator.  They can be changed
through the GUI except for F1 and ESC :

Disable Backgrounds 1,2,3,4  = 1,2,3,4
Disable Sprites              = 5
Panic Key (enable all)       = 6
Enable SNES Mouse/SuperScope = 7
Enable New Graphics Engine   = 8
Disable Windowing            = 9
Disable OffsetMode           = 0
Fast Forward Key             = ~
PopUp Extra Menu             = F1
Save State                   = F2
Switch State                 = F3
Load State                   = F4
Disable Sound Channel        = F5 - F12
Quit                         = ESC

Here are the default keys for the game play (unless modified through the GUI):

Player 1 :

Up,Down,Left,Right : Cursor Keys
A,B,X,Y            : X,Z,S,A
L,R                : D,C
Start, Select      : Enter, RShift

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.) Extra Pop-Up Menu (F1 Menu)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Save Snapshot - Saves a snapshot as either .PCX (8-bit color) or .BMP
                (16-bit color)

Show/Hide FPS - Shows or hides the frame per second display which appears
                on the bottom-left corner of the screen.  This can only
                be enabled in auto-frame rate mode.

Save SPC Data - Selecting this will search for the beginning of the next
                song and save the data into a .spc file which saves it
                similarly as a .srm file.  To capture a song, it is best
                recommended to initiate this feature approx 2 seconds
                before the next song starts.  This does have potential to
                fail though so don't expect it to work all the time.
                Also, this feature doesn't work in the new gfx engine.

Sound Buffer Dump - This dumps the sound buffer in zsnes and also filters
                out any unoccupied space.  The sound buffer contains
                decompressed samples which are written to when zsnes
                plays/decodes a sample from sound memory. Because of the
                way zsnes buffers the sound data, this can produce
                inaccurate results.

Snapshot/Increment Frame - Same as snapshot, but it returns to the F1 menu
                after a couple frames.  Useful for making animations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.) Configuration File (ZSNESW.CFG)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Almost everything in zsnes.cfg should now be editable through the gui

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.) Cheat Codes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, ZSNES supports Game Genie, Pro Action Replay and GoldFinger codes

Here are the steps to get the codes working :

1.) Load the ROM which you want to patch
2.) Exit to the GUI, enter the code of your choice in the cheat menu
3.) After that, you may have to RESET the game to get the cheat code to
      work.  Sometimes, it is not necessary.  You also may have to click
      on the FIX button.

NOTE : Some cheat codes are meant to be for different versions of the game.
       If a cheat code doesn't work and there is one for both Game Genie
         and Pro Action Replay, try them both.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.) Extra Features (SNES Mouse/Super Scope/SuperFX/DSP1/MultiTap)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Enable SNES Mouse, Press 7 once for 1st player and twice for 2nd player
To Enable SNES Super Scope, Press 7 three times
To disable either one, either press 6 or press 7 until you see a disable
   message onscreen.

Here are the controls for the Super Scope :

  Fire = Left Mouse button
  Cursor Mode Button = Right Mouse button
  Pause = Backspace Key on keyboard
  Enable/Disable Autofire = =/+ key on keyboard, should be located to the
                       left of the backspace key

DSP1 is enabled automatically.  Currently, it runs mario kart and some other
    games, but it does not run pilotwings due to a lack of dsp1 functions
    that are implemented.

Zsnes auto-detects the SFX emulation from the header and enables it when
   found.  Also, take note that the SFX is an additional 10Mhz(Ver1) or
   20Mhz(Ver2) chip which also has to be emulated with the snes and will
   most likely produce a very noticeable slow down in emulation if you
   don't have a fast computer.

Sometimes, the Multitap isn't compatible with some games.  If that happens,
   disable Multitap by setting Player3,4, and 5's input device to 'None' in
   the GUI

IPS patcher :
   Rename your .IPS file to the rom filename with the .IPS extension
   (eg.  If your rom is SD3.SMC and your rom is SD3V05.IPS, rename SD3V05.IPS
         to SD3.IPS)
   and ZSNES will patch the rom realtime without modifying the rom file's
   contents.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.) Bugs Section
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 65816 lacks correct timing.  Although ZSNES bases the timing on a
  variable cycle/instruction, it does not deduct correct values such
  as 16bit instructions should deduct 1 more cycle than 8bit instructions.
  100% cycles of zsnes isn't 100% cycles of a snes because of that.
  This means that a lot of games either won't run or will produce horrible
  displays.  Sometimes adjusting the % of execution can fix those problems.
  This is due to inaccurate documentation used when the 65816 was written.
  There is no plans on re-writing the 65816 timing yet.
- Games sometimes tend to not display things properly because of graphic
  features that aren't implemented yet
- The Sound DSP chip still has its bugs (not many though)
