ZSNES 1.36 for Mac with netplay!!

The reason I made this port is so that I can enjoy netplay on ZSNES on my MacBookPro. For more details, please see http://www.bazz1.com/snes

Dependencies
------------
ZLib (I used 1.2.8) and SDL 1.2.15 must be compiled in 32-bit mode.
Instructions may be found in Changes_BAZZ.txt. I haven't made this "Compileable" by the rest of the world yet, so I recommend you don't try and compile this. You could cause a brain pain. I currently have static binaries available on my website to save you the trouble. Code is really only here cause of GPL2.
